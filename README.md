- Auto‑merging of audio + video streams using **ffmpeg**
- Clear troubleshooting and example commands

> ⚠️ Use only for videos you are authorized to access. Respect site Terms and local law.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### macOS
```bash
# Install Homebrew (if needed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install tools
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg

# Make the helper executable and run it
chmod +x ./hf-dl.sh
./hf-dl.sh
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Install tools (Windows 10/11)
winget install yt-dlp.yt-dlp
winget install Gyan.FFmpeg

# Allow scripts if blocked
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

# Run helper
.\hf-dl-win.ps1
```

> Before running either script, export cookies with **Get cookies.txt LOCALLY** in Chrome and save as `cookies.txt` (e.g., in Downloads).

## 🧩 Key Features

- ✅ Works on **macOS** and **Windows**
- 🔑 Handles **login‑protected** videos using exported cookies
- 🎞️ Merges separate video + audio streams (via **ffmpeg**)
- 📂 Organizes course playlists into titled folders with numbered lessons
- 🧠 Minimal commands — fully guided through prompts

---

## 1) Install yt‑dlp and ffmpeg

### macOS (Homebrew recommended)
```bash
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg
yt-dlp --version
ffmpeg -version
```

### Windows
```powershell
winget install yt-dlp.yt-dlp
winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
yt-dlp --version
ffmpeg -version
```

Alternative package managers: `choco install yt-dlp ffmpeg` (Chocolatey) or `pip install -U yt-dlp`.

---

## 2) Export Cookies (Chrome)

Install **Get cookies.txt LOCALLY** from the Chrome Web Store.

Steps:
1. Log in to the site (play the video).
2. Click the 🍪 extension → **Export/Download cookies**.
3. Save as `cookies.txt` (e.g., in Downloads). Keep it **private**; it contains session tokens.

> Safari uses a different cookie storage; Chrome or Firefox are simpler.

---

## 3) Example Commands

**Single video (best quality):**
```bash
yt-dlp --cookies cookies.txt -f "bestvideo+bestaudio/best"   -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" "https://example.com/video-url"
```

**Entire playlist/course (auto folders + numbering):**
```bash
yt-dlp --cookies cookies.txt --yes-playlist -f "bestvideo+bestaudio/best"   -o "%(playlist_title)s/%(playlist_index)03d - %(title)s.%(ext)s"   "https://example.com/course-url"
```

---

## 4) Common Issue: Two Files (video‑only + audio‑only)

If you see two separate MP4s (no sound), it means `ffmpeg` is missing.  
Install it and re‑run the command or helper script.

Force merge (optional):
```bash
yt-dlp -f "bestvideo+bestaudio/best" --merge-output-format mp4 "URL"
```

---

## 5) Helper Scripts

### macOS — `hf-dl.sh`
Interactive Bash script that prompts for URL, cookies path, output folder, and playlist mode.

### Windows — `hf-dl-win.ps1`
Equivalent PowerShell helper for Windows systems.

> Both scripts ensure optimal quality, correct naming, and automatic merging of video + audio.
